# Description

Plugin dedicated to Blink cameras.

It allows you to display videos from different cameras.

[**&rarr; Link to GITHUB for this free plugin**](https://github.com/d9-197/blink_camera)

The following actions are available (depending on the camera model):
- to arm/disarm the motion detection of a system
- to arm/disarm the motion detection of a camera.
- Take a video
- Take photo (updated camera thumbnail)
- View a camera's latest video history (with option to download videos or delete them)

Camera information is also available:
* Date of the last event,
* URL and path of the last video (and its thumbnail),
* Camera thumbnail URL and path (from "Take a photo")
* wifi power,
* Temperature,
* Battery status,
* [Doorbell only] Source of the last evebt ("pir" for IR detection, "button_press" pour the button)

>**In the plugin, some types of Blink camera do not have the same capabilities as other. Then some functions or information can not be available for these types of camera.**

**Case of the local storage**\
There are 3 storage configurations for camera videos/images.
- "Cloud": Storage on the Blink Cloud
- "Local": Storage on a USB key : a synchronisation module v2 is required
- "No storage": no Cloud, no USB key.

The "Cloud" and "Local" configurations allow the plugin to obtain the last event (every minutes : it is not instantaneous).
The "No storage" configuration does not allow obtaining the last event and does not allow obtaining videos/images. In this case, this plugin is not very useful.   

# Blink accounts
You can add one or sevral Blink accounts.

  + Enter the email, password and pin code associated with your Blink account. (The pin code entry field is only displayed when the connection is not yet validated)

>**Important point about the PIN code sent by Blink:**\
>Blink regularly asks you to re-enter the PIN code (the duration between 2 requests is variable - and independent of the plugin). When this happens, you then receive a PIN code from Blink but the plugin does not have the information that a new code must be entered. In this case, it is likely that the PIN code field is not displayed in the plugin.\
**You must then force a PIN code request from the plugin** (and therefore the redisplay of the field). To do this, enter a __bad__ email or password then save (at this stage you will have an error: which is normal since the email or password are not correct), then enter the correct email and password and save .\
**A new PIN code is then sent to you by Blink.**
The PIN code entry field will appear in the plugin config.\

# Configuration of the plugin

In the plugin configuration screen the following options are available:

* Security
  + _"Block access to video and image URLs without being authenticated in Jeedom?"_
    - If the box is checked, the URLs of the videos (and images) can only be opened if the user is already connected to Jeedom
    - If the box is not checked, the urls are freely accessible

  + Jeedom address to use for URLs: allows you to choose which Jeedom URL will be used in the "Last video URL" and "Thumbnail URL" info.
    *These URLs correspond to those you have defined in the configuration of your Jeedom system: "Settings / System / Configuration" menu then "Networks" tab: internal access or external access.*

>**It is advisable to choose "External access" only if you have checked "Block access to URLs..."**


* Widget
  + Thumbnail content: allows you to choose what is displayed in the widget
    + If you choose "Last video", a checkbox is displayed to choose whether to display (or not) the thumbnail of the camera if there are no videos.

  + Thumbnail size: allows you to define the reduction to be applied (as a percentage of the initial size).
    
* Historical view
  > This view is accessible from the widget. It displays the latest videos/thumbnails available
  + The maximum number of downloaded videos allows you to limit the amount of data to download when opening the historical view.
  + The size of the video previews can also be configured.

    *Warning: If you configure a large size and a large number of videos, this can cause slowness in the historical view*

  + Eco mode: This mode limits the quantity of data exchanged:
    + between Jeedom and your browser: a video is downloaded to your browser only when you click on it.
    + between the Blink and Jeedom servers: only data already present on Jeedom is displayed.


* Backup
  + This option allows you to include videos and images in Jeedom backups.
  
  **CAUTION: this option will cause a significant increase in the size of the Jeedom backup**

>**Don't forget to click on the "Save" button**
